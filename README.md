# CNN Item Classification

## Introduction
Second part of the project for the Image Processing and Computer Vision course (A.Y. 2023-2024). The project consists of two separate assignments. The first assignment can be found in the repo [Instance Detection](https://github.com/FabioGiordana/Instance-Detection)

## Description
The project is divided into two parts:
* Implementation and training from scratch of a CNN classifier
* Finetunining of an existing model (ResNet-18)
Both the classification tasks are performed on the [Grocery Store Dataset](https://github.com/marcusklasson/GroceryStoreDataset)
